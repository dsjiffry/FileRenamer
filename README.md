# Android Studio Resource Renamer
In Android Studio our resources cannot have capital letters or spaces in their names. This program will recursively make all file names lowercase and replace spaces/dashes with underscores.

This is convienient if you import resorces from other sources (like adobe XD) and they do not match Android Studio's naming standards. So you can keep a copy of the jar file and in the 'res' folder and run it to rename all the files.

You can get the working program from the Releases tab, download and run the .jar file.
